## 🌟 General Description
This project is written in **Pascal**. It aims to demonstrate the basic capabilities of the language and solve educational tasks.


## 🛠️ Technical Requirements
### 🎯 Your Goal:
Develop a program for a "Cash Register".

### 📑 Program Functionality:

1. **Product List Display**:
   - Show a list of products that includes the name and price per unit or per weight. 

2. **Add Products to Cart**:
   - Implement a function to add products to the cart, followed by displaying the shopping list (a list of products added to the cart along with their prices).
   - If the same product is added multiple times, the quantity should be reflected in the string.

3. **Payment Function**:
   - Create a payment function that generates a cheque after payment.
   - The receipt should include information about the list of products, the cost of each product, and the total price.

4. **Program Stability**:
   - Ensure the program runs smoothly without crashing on incorrect data input.
   - The program should only terminate upon payment completion or when a specific exit function is selected. 

### 💡 Notes:
- Make sure to handle user inputs gracefully to enhance the user experience.
- Consider implementing error handling to manage unexpected inputs effectively.
